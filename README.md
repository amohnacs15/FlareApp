# Flare

Having access to the help you need, when you need can make a big difference. We created Flare to answer life's present demands by empowering users with the ability to make a difference in their communities.

Flare gives users the ability to intereract on a peer to peer level, in addition to having access to a suit of paid services. 

Next time you need help with something, anything, or simply want to make an impact, think Flare.
